# Title
Using ADR for keeping architecture decisions.

# Status
Accepted

# Context
There are many decisions taken for the project over time. But it is difficult to understand later when new scenarios encountered. Also it is difficult when decisions are not connected with code.

# Decision
Use Lightweight Architecture Decision Records

# Consequences
When there are a lot of decisions over time, it would be difficult to search
